    <h1><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm George, a senior studying ICT. I'm from Ohio, and I originally was studying Computer Science
    in the engineering college. Outside of class I like cooking, hiking or hammocking, and just being outdoors in general. I'm also a big
     hockey fan, waiting for the season to start back up. I sometimes code for fun too, finding small projects or games
      to do online.This class has been interesting so far, and I think it will be useful in the future.   </p>
